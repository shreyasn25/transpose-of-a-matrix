# transpose-of-a-matrix
For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. First row can be selected as X[0] and the element in first row, first column can be selected as X[0][0].  Transpose of a matrix is the interchanging of rows and columns. It is denoted as X'. The element at ith row and jth column in X will be placed at jth row and ith column in X'. So if X is a 3x2 matrix, X' will be a 2x3 matrix.
